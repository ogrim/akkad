# akkad

akkad is a client/server CLI tool to quickly get some particular data off the web. Server is implement in Clojure, and the client can be any program capable of HTTP GET request. A client will be implemented in a suitable language in the future.

Currently not functional. I am writing akkad because I am often using different dictionaries and other regular data lookups in my web browser. I would prefer to do this in the terminal, with less clutter and bloat. akkad will use pre-defined interfaces to only get the relevant data, and print it in a pleasing manner.

## Usage

Run akkad as a service anyhow you please, but it's nice to have in a GNU Screen.
